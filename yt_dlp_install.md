First, download the binary executable:

`curl -LO https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp`

Then, make the binary file executable via

`chmod a+rx ~/.local/bin/yt-dlp`

Optionally expose it to `$PATH`.

Be sure to also install `ffmpeg` via `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` so audio and video formats could be merged together.
